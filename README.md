# GOT_PersonalityTest
Personality test to find out which Game of Thrones character matches with your personality the most with the help of machine learning.

Steps:
1. Find a simple personality test (might need a UI)
2. Map the personality types to GOT characters
   Figure out a way to map the character personalities using the GOT dialogue corpus.
   Sentiment analysis?
3. Calculate a personality score for the user input (maybe classification) and output the closest personality character.

Notes:
1. Figure out where to host
2. Should be flexible enough to work with series/tv show character corpus (Eg: Friends, Naruto, CEO's)
